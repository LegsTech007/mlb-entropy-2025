# MLB 2025 Outcome Entropy

This project computes and publishes **plate appearance outcome entropy** for all MLB players (2025 season).  
Entropy measures the diversity of outcomes (HR, K, BB, 1B, etc.) â€” higher entropy = more unpredictable, lower = more predictable.

## Contents
- `index.html` â€“ Web page that loads CSVs and displays interactive tables
- `entropy_players.csv` â€“ Entropy results by player
- `entropy_teams.csv` â€“ Entropy results by team (if generated)
